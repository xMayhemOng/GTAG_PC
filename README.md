# GTAG_PC
This is for the people that want to play gorilla tag but.... not on vr. You cant control your arms but you can move your body in where ever you want it to!

You need to install monkey mod manager in order for this to work.
Then, of course you need Gorilla Tag.
Go to monke mod manager>utilites>game files
Then copy and paste the Managed file in the downloads for this. Gorilla tag>Gorilla Tag_data>Managed 
For the Unity file you go Gorilla Tag>Gorilla Tag_data>Resources Then paste the Unity files into there.
This is for the camera mod to move in the game. Gorilla Tag>Gorilla Tag_data>Plugins then paste the SeventiesCameraMod into there.

-----------------------------You are finally done and can troll in Gorilla Tag as a fake ai with a soundboard------------------------------------------
